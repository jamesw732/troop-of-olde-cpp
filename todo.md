# Right now:
- Figure out bug where landing seems to be janky

- Can jump through the wall with >90 degree incline. Consider a fix for this, or just never
generate meshes with this property.

- Add basic "3d quad" and "cube" models to the model map, and remove ModelType component/handling

# Coming soon:

## Load character model

## Animate character movement

## Combat???
