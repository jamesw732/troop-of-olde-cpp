# Right now:
- Clean up WSL/tmux environment.
Wants:
    - Compilation blocks client/server execution
    - Can start tmux session from within vim, or can start tmux session without compiling/running executables

- Consider cleaning up physics.hpp to use raylib-cpp types.
This will require using raylib::Ray, should be reasonable.

- Do the network data logging thing

I wrote this months ago and I should figure out what it means:
- Add basic "3d quad" and "cube" models to the model map, and remove ModelType component/handling

# Coming soon:

## Load character model

## Animate character movement

## Combat???
