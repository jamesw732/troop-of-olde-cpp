# Right now:

## Collision physics
- Fix bugs with server-side meshes:
  - Seg faulting half the time I run
  - Mesh collision is wrong, can go off edge while server thinks it's good, sometimes fall through the floor
- Add generic mesh collision logic
- Add basic "3d quad" and "cube" models to the model map, and remove ModelType component/handling

# Coming soon:

## Load character model

## Animate character movement
