# Right now:
- Physics is not 100% correct:
    - Character shakes
    - Managed to clip through ground once

- Consider cleaning up physics.hpp to use raylib-cpp types.
This will require using raylib::Ray, should be reasonable.

- Do the network data logging thing

I wrote this months ago and I should figure out what it means:
- Add basic "3d quad" and "cube" models to the model map, and remove ModelType component/handling

# Coming soon:

## Load character model

## Animate character movement

## Combat???
