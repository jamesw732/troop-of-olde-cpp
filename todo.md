# Right now:
- Physics is not 100% correct:
    - Character shakes when touching the ground - Client and server might disagree on
        physics slightly? 
    - Managed to clip through ground several times. Seems to be related to server, if one
        client passes through ground at the start then every client will. 

- Do the network data logging thing

I wrote this months ago and I should figure out what it means:
- Add basic "3d quad" and "cube" models to the model map, and remove ModelType component/handling

# Coming soon:

## Load character model

## Animate character movement

## Combat???
